# XFM2_GetterSetter
small JavaFX application to read/write &amp; text edit XFM2 json patches, see also:

Application was made for personal usage. I did not code in Java for > 15 years and code is against all coding conventions, but it works (kind of, at least for me ;) ).

Serial device path is hard coded, but should work on Linux, MacOS and Windows, see code
